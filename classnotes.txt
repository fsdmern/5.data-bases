Normalization
==============
Normalization is a database design technique that reduces redundancy and eliminates undesirables characteristics such as anomalies in insertion, updates and deletions.

The purpose of Normalization is to eliminate repetitive data and ensure data is stored logically

process: 
========
Normalization rules divide larger tables into smaller tables and links these tables using relationships

Normal Forms:
=============
1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF (Boyce-codd normal form)

1NF:
====
Each cell should contain a single
Each Record needs to be unique

KEY:
====
In SQL key is a single column or combination of mutiple columns used to uniquely identify rows in the table. It helps identification of duplication data and also helps to maintain relationships with other tables

PRIMARY KEY (PK):
============
A primary key is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely

Properties of PK:
=====================
A PK cannot be NULL
A PK must be unique
The PK values should be rarely changed
The PK must be given a value when a new record is inserted

Composite KEY:
================
A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely



2NF:
====
Rule1: Be in 1NF
Rule2: Single Column Primary Key that doesnt funationally dependant on any subset of candiate key relationships

Functional Dependency:
=======================
change of data in one column requires change in another column
